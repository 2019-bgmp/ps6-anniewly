1. The number of contigs decreases as the kmer size increases. And the maximum appears to be higher at higher kmer size. Higher kmer size also demonstrates a higher depth of coverage. N50 value increases. As kmer size increases, the distribution become wider and shorter.
2. For larger cutoff, the number of the contigs decreases and the N50 value increases. We also see a narrower contig length distribution.
3. Increasing minimum cotig length also increases the N50 value. We have a wide but short distribution for contig length.
